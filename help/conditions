Conditions

Note
   Conditions are defined using the following format:
   <metadatafield>=<value>
   The metadta field can be anything that can be injected as metadta in a Vorbis tag.

Example
    You want to exclude everything from "GENRE" "Pop":
    dam exclude "GENRE=Pop"
    
    ...but want to keep Lady Gaga, just because
    dam include "ARTIST=Lady Gaga"

    ...but not THAT album
    dam exclude "ALBUM=THAT"
